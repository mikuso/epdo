# EPDO
An extension to PDO, for a better quality of life. Designed specifically for use with MySQL/MariaDB.

This library introduces 2 new classes:
- `EPDO` - an extended version of `PDO`. Can work as a drop-in replacement.
- `EPDOResult` - a class representing a result set

In addition, all instances of EPDO have some sensible presets:
- `PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE = PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION`  
  All errors throw exceptions.

- `PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES = false`  
  Allows `prepare()` to throw Exceptions, and allows non-string values to be returned in result sets.

## Getting started
```php
require_once 'EPDO.php';

$db = new EPDO(/* dsn */, /* user */, /* pass */);

$results = $db(/* sql */, /* ...params */);
// $results is an EPDOResult object

// iterate over the results
foreach ($results as $row) {
    // do something with $row
}
```

### EPDO

#### $db( string $sql [, array ...$params ] ) : EPDOResult

Prepare, bind, execute and fetch the results of an SQL query.
All result rows will be returned as `stdClass` objects.

See [Escaping Queries] for examples.

#### $db->transaction( callable $callback )

An easy way to write transactions.

All queries executed within the callback function will either:
- all succeed
- all fail

Eliminates the possibility of introducing inconsistent states into your data.

Returns the return value of the callback.

Example:
```php
$db->transaction(function($db){
    $r1 = $db("INSERT INTO t1 SET ?", ["a" => "bc"]);

    $r2 = $db("SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE id = ?", $r1->lastId);

    echo $r2->first->a; // "bc"

    throw new Exception("oops");
    // Exception is thrown, so the transaction is rolled back
});

// The transaction failed, so no data has been modified
$db("SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE a = ?", "bc")->first; // NULL
```

### EPDOResult

EPDOResult ($results) is an iterable just like any ordinary array, but has a few extra properties...

#### $results->first

Get the first result of the result set.  
If no results returned, will return NULL instead.

#### $results->all

Get a raw array of results.  
You shouldn't normally need this, as the `EPDOResult` object is iterable just like an array.

#### $results->lastId

Get the last Insert ID / Auto-Increment value generated by the query.  
Works similarly to `$db->lastInsertId()` except that `$result->lastId` won't ever change.

#### $results->affectedRows

Get the number of rows affected by the last `INSERT`/`UPDATE` - or the number of rows returned in the result set.

#### $results->count

Get the number of rows returned in the result set.

#### $results->value

Get the value of the first column of the first row of results.

#### echo $results

Reveals some useful debug information about the result object.

Example:
```
EPDOResult:
----------------
Results        : 0
Affected Rows  : 2
Last Insert Id : 72
Query          ->
    INSERT INTO t1 (a, b) VALUES (?, ?), (?, ?)

First Result   ->
    NULL
```

## Escaping Queries

It is not necessary to escape any user input with this library - you simply need to pass the user input as parameters, and use `?` (question mark) placeholders in your SQL string.

The simplest query does not require any parameters or placeholders:
```php
// select some rows
$db("
    SELECT *
    FROM t1
    LIMIT 5
");
```

Here's how you can pass a single scalar parameter with a query:
```php
// select rows where `t1.id` > 5
$db("
    SELECT *
    FROM t1
    WHERE id > ?
", 5);
```

Here's how you to pass multiple scalar parameters with a query:
```php
// select rows where `t1.id` is between 5 and 10 (inclusive)
$db("
    SELECT *
    FROM t1
    WHERE id >= ?
    AND id =< ?
", 5, 10);
```

You can also pass indexed arrays as parameters:
```php
// select rows where `t1.id` is either 1,2 or 3
$db("
    SELECT *
    FROM t1
    WHERE id IN (?)
", [1,2,3]);

// equivalent to...
$db("
    SELECT *
    FROM t1
    WHERE id IN (?,?,?)
", 1, 2, 3);
```

To perform a batch `INSERT`, you can nest multiple arrays:
```php
$db("
    INSERT INTO t1 (a, b) VALUES ?
", [
    [1,2],
    [3,4],
    [5,6]
]);

// equivalent to...
$db("
    INSERT INTO t1 (a, b) VALUES (?,?),(?,?),(?,?)
", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
```

To perform an `INSERT INTO ... SET`, you can pass objects or associative arrays:
```php
$db("
    INSERT INTO t1 SET ?
", [
    "a" => 1,
    "b" => 2
]);

// equivalent to...
$db("
    INSERT INTO t1 SET
        `a` = ?,
        `b` = ?
", 1, 2);
```

And of course, you can mix and match scalars, objects and indexed arrays:
```php
// update all rows where `t1.id` is either 1, 2 or 3 - and `a` > 5, setting `a` = 2, `b` = 3
$db("
    UPDATE t1
    SET ?
    WHERE id IN ?
    AND a > ?
",
    [ "a" => 2, "b" => 3],
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    5
);
```
